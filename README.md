# 🌱 Carbon Fossil Assessment System

A web application aimed at quantifying the carbon footprint of Indian coal mines and providing insights into pathways toward carbon neutrality.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Coal mines in India are a major source of carbon emissions, yet there's no dedicated digital platform to assess their carbon footprint and suggest actionable steps toward sustainability. This system bridges that gap by offering data-driven assessment, visualization, and recommendations for carbon management in coal-based operations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧮 **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: Input mine-specific data to estimate total emissions.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Graphs and charts to monitor emissions and progress.
- 📍 **Geo-location Mapping**: Track mines and their respective carbon statistics on a map.
- ♻️ **Sustainability Suggestions**: Recommends steps to reduce carbon emissions.
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Insights** (Future Scope): Use historical data to predict and optimize carbon outputs.
